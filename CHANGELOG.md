## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Separate reasoning output items with content-part events (aligns with Responses API)
- Usage propagation from upstream streaming chunks when available

### Changed
- Output indices now follow creation order across message/reasoning/tool items
- response.completed now preserves tool-call items in non-streaming mode for parity with streaming
- response objects now inherit instructions/metadata/tool_choice/temperature/top_p from requests

### Fixed
- Avoid empty message items when tool-only rounds are suppressed

## [0.4.8] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- Raw upstream chunk logging (`LOG_STREAM_RAW`) for streaming diagnostics
- Output suppression toggles for tool-call rounds (`SUPPRESS_ASSISTANT_TEXT_WHEN_TOOLS`, `DEFER_OUTPUT_TEXT_UNTIL_DONE`)
- Auto-update on startup (checks npm latest and installs if newer; can be disabled via config)

### Fixed
- De-duplicate streaming deltas when providers emit full-content chunks
- Only suppress assistant output_text when finish_reason is tool_calls (avoid hiding short final replies)
- Route suppressed tool-call round text into reasoning stream so it remains visible

## [0.4.7] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- Do not include function_call items in response.completed output (restore local tool execution)

### Changed
- Forward reasoning controls to upstream and accept reasoning text from alternative fields

### Docs
- Document reasoning passthrough and reasoning_text events
- Clarify that response.completed output excludes function_call items for local tool execution

### Docs
- Document reasoning passthrough and reasoning_text events
- Clarify that response.completed output excludes function_call items for local tool execution

## [0.4.6] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- Avoid empty output_text items in tool-only streaming responses
- Only emit output_text.done/content_part.done when output text exists

## [0.4.5] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- Handle streaming tool_calls without `index` by assigning a stable fallback index
- Improve tool name logging when tools define top-level `name`

## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- Normalize `bin` path and repository URL for npm publish compatibility

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- Auto-enable tool bridging when tool-related fields are present in the request
- Extra logging to surface `allowTools` and `toolsPresent` per request
- Debug tool summary logging (types and sample names)

### Fixed
- Correct output_index mapping for streaming tool call events
- Filter non-function tools to avoid upstream schema errors

### Changed
- README guidance for MCP/tools troubleshooting and proxy startup

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-16

### Changed
- Replaced the README with expanded setup, usage, and troubleshooting guidance
- Clarified Codex provider configuration and proxy endpoint usage

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- Tool calling support (MCP/function calls) when `ALLOW_TOOLS=1`
- Bridging for `function_call_output` items to Chat `role: tool` messages
- Streaming support for `delta.tool_calls` with proper Responses API events
- Non-streaming support for `msg.tool_calls` in final response
- Tool call events: `response.output_item.added` (function_call), `response.function_call_arguments.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.done`
- Automated tool call test in test suite

### Changed
- `translateResponsesToChat()` now handles `type: function_call_output` items
- `streamChatToResponses()` now detects and emits tool call events
- `translateChatToResponses()` now includes `function_call` items in output array

### Fixed
- Tool responses (from MCP/function calls) are now correctly forwarded to upstream as `role: tool` messages
- Function call items are now properly included in `response.completed` output array

## [0.4.0] - Previous

### Added
- Initial release with Responses API to Chat Completions translation
- Streaming support with SSE
- Health check endpoint
- Zero-dependency implementation
